# SGD-Regressor-for-Multivariate-Linear-Regression

## AIM:
To write a program to predict the price of the house and number of occupants in the house with SGD regressor.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook

## Algorithm
1. Load California housing data, select features and targets, and split into training and testing sets.

2.Scale both X (features) and Y (targets) using StandardScaler. 

3. Use SGDRegressor wrapped in MultiOutputRegressor to train on the scaled training data.

4. Predict on test data, inverse transform the results, and calculate the mean squared error.

## Program:

#Manual Implementation using Numpy
import numpy as np

# ------------------------------
# Step 1: Sample dataset
# ------------------------------
# Features: [Hours Studied, Attendance, Previous Marks]
X = np.array([
    [2, 80, 50],
    [3, 60, 40],
    [5, 90, 70],
    [7, 85, 80],
    [9, 95, 90]
], dtype=float)

# Target: Marks Scored
y = np.array([50, 45, 70, 80, 95], dtype=float)

# ------------------------------
# Step 2: Feature normalization
# ------------------------------
X_mean = X.mean(axis=0)
X_std = X.std(axis=0)
X = (X - X_mean) / X_std

# Add bias term (intercept)
X = np.c_[np.ones(X.shape[0]), X]  # shape becomes (n_samples, n_features + 1)

# ------------------------------
# Step 3: Initialize weights
# ------------------------------
n_features = X.shape[1]
weights = np.zeros(n_features)

# Hyperparameters
learning_rate = 0.01
epochs = 1000

# ------------------------------
# Step 4: Stochastic Gradient Descent
# ------------------------------
for epoch in range(epochs):
    for i in range(X.shape[0]):
        xi = X[i]
        yi = y[i]
        y_pred = np.dot(xi, weights)
        error = y_pred - yi
        # Update weights
        weights -= learning_rate * error * xi

print("Trained Weights (including intercept):", weights)

# ------------------------------
# Step 5: Make predictions
# ------------------------------
y_pred_all = np.dot(X, weights)
print("Predicted values:", y_pred_all)
```
```
#Using scikit-learn SGDRegressor
from sklearn.linear_model import SGDRegressor
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Features and target
X = np.array([
    [2, 80, 50],
    [3, 60, 40],
    [5, 90, 70],
    [7, 85, 80],
    [9, 95, 90]
])
y = np.array([50, 45, 70, 80, 95])

# Feature scaling
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)

# Create SGD Regressor
sgd_reg = SGDRegressor(max_iter=1000, learning_rate='invscaling', eta0=0.01, random_state=42)
sgd_reg.fit(X_scaled, y)

# Coefficients and intercept
print("Weights (coefficients):", sgd_reg.coef_)
print("Intercept:", sgd_reg.intercept_)

# Predictions
y_pred = sgd_reg.predict(X_scaled)
print("Predicted values:", y_pred)
